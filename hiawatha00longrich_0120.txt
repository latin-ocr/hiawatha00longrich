As regards spelling, a learner ought to be accustomed to
every form of words used in the current· editions. I there-
fore think it better not to be uniform as to Vertex and
Vortex, Vultur and Voltur, Caelum and eoelum, Maestus
and Moestus, &0. 'Phe Italians having long ago lost all
distinction of ἑ, ae, oe, no weight· whatever seems to be due
to MSS. on this point ; and the opposite etymologies pleaded
are too uncerssain to rest upon. But Ι have preferred the
accus. pl. in -eis, (when the gen. pl. ie in -iumfi not only as
a little elevating the style, but also because it is always
better to learn from the beginning the fullest admissible dis-
crimination of the cases. 1 have intended to distinguish by
quantity-marks all words really doubtful, as well as by the
circumflex on ablatives in a and genitives in us.
