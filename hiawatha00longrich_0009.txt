Palemon. vii

the native legends which he has followed appeared
to me too puerile, tedious or obscure. I do not
here profess to be a mere translator3 for I have
widely other objects in view: yet not only have I
very often translated with minute accuracy, but I
have never introduced ornaments of my own. If
any one unacquainted with the original should read
my Latin, he must attribute whatever in it he finds
of beauty to the genius of Mr. Longfellow.

The names of certain birds and beasts, as also
a few things essentially modern, could not be
expressed by Latin words found in the existing
classics Îµ but that is of absolutely no importance, if
only the new words be formed according to strict
classical analogies. Nevertheless, it seems right to
annex a short Glossary for the student's con-
venience.
